Service Video 

Bridge was Yu-ting’s graduate project at RCA exploring globally systemic issues in education, prototyped and validated in the live schooling field in Taiwan. During the design process, Yu-ting embedded service design methodology with stakeholders of primary school, trying to build a decentralised platform and to make an organisational impact.

## Design

### **Bridge** is a vision for a service platform designed as an assistant for primary school teachers experiencing curriculum reform in Taiwan to foster lifelong competencies in their pupils and strengthen relationships between parents, schools and students.

**How might we create competence-oriented friendly teaching & learning environment with teachers ?**

**Subjects Goals + Teaching Activities + Social Issues**

In terms of **"Teaching Activities"**, they are 6 guidance modules called **Depicting**, **Observing**, **Comparing**, **Empathising**, **Evaluating** and **Acting**. All of them are driven by creating powerful toolkits and components for teachers inspiring and nurturing children’s motivation to learn.

![/photos/bridge/Bridge_-_Final_Exam.001.png](/photos/bridge/Bridge_-_Final_Exam.001.png)

These teaching activities help teachers to flexibly connect with **Subjects Goals and Social issues both,** as a result, we can together address the new curricula reform’s goal relating to Competence-oriented teaching methods.

- Example

    Modules co-creation and iteration with 3 experts and teachers. Each of these key components has linked toolkits to facilitate teaching, and helping to design the content of teachers' lessons.

**On the other hand, how might we bring confidence in the education system to keep teachers status of teaching profession when they try the new reform ?**

No matter how the reform has been changed, 
**their's an unclear validation of learning results in the reform, and it is going to shake status of teachers teaching profession...**

    ### **Creating competence-oriented friendly learning experience**

    Future-ready students need to exercise agency, in their own education and throughout life. Agency implies a sense of responsibility to participate in the world and, in so doing, to influence people, events and circumstances for the better. The concept of competency implies more than just the acquisition of knowledge and skills; it involves the mobilisation of knowledge, skills, attitudes and values to meet complex demands. Future-ready students will need both broad and specialised knowledge.

    ### To transform the teaching experience for primary school teachers who face curriculum reform in Taiwan

    Education system in Taiwan has put its entire focus on the outcome of achieving high grades, rather than the process of learning. As a result students feel unmotivated and deprived of a wider curriculum. Although parents would like to see their child succeed, as they have grown up with these norms, their own experience tends to influence how they protect and support their own children. Moreover, teachers in school keep this test-oriented pedagogy to meet the expectations of parents and society as a whole. Head teachers need to advertise to attract more children to study at their schools, so teachers need to be competitive to show how they can lead children to achieve high grades. A long held belief in the supreme value of academic achievement is overshadowing the abilities to think, judge, feel, and imagine in our learning process. These competencies, vital to our growth as a society, are absent from our grading systems, with no intersection between academic education and social development in our primary schools.

- The Situation in Taiwan (II) : Gaps between policy and implementation

    ### Loss of confidence in reforms & Lack of service provider and receiver-centred solutions

    Since 1990, education in Taiwan has experienced several waves of unclear, temporary reform, with more than a dozen ministers of education, leaving people feeling anxious, worried, and gradually losing confidence in the system. More than 80% of teachers believe that the most important thing is for the system to trust in teachers and respect the teaching profession. Furthermore, over 50% of teachers said that there’s a huge gap between policy and the teaching process, with a lack of consideration for the reality of implementation for teachers.

    *Figure 1 : Representing the learner-centred focus of current pupil’s learning lifecycle*

    [Figure 1] Undoubtedly, teachers are the key characters when we represent the learner-centred focus of current pupil’s learning lifecycle. **Learner’s underlying needs is to getting good grades at the school**, so they try to gather best materials, comprehensively understand what they learn, feel reassured by practicing tasks after schools and take examination to prove their proficiency in a subject. During phases of realising and being evaluated, teachers act as the key stakeholder providing sufficient and clear learning activities and evaluation of learners’ performances. 

    However, in the new reform, **learner’s need is defined to cultivate competence-oriented skills**, so how can teachers, as the key person within pupil’s learning lifecycle, deliver competence-oriented teaching activities and evaluation of these soft-skills ? [Figure 2] [Figure 3]

    Figure 3 : Representing the teacher-centred focus of current teaching lifecycle

    No matter how the reform has been changed, 
    **teachers’ underlying goal** is always to **keep their status of teaching profession.**

- Key Insights : Teachers are key characters to eliminate gaps between policy and practices. 
But it didn't work...
    1. **Designing and conducting new curriculum plans are more difficult for teachers individually.**
    2. **Teachers still feel pressure from the legacy of the old system whilst transitioning to the new reform.**
    3. **Lack of willingness to try new ways of teaching.**
    4. **Parents do not adequately understand their children’s learning achievements at the school.**



- Opportunities & Ecosystem of teaching experience
    1. **During the phase of preparing lessons plans :**
    it’s creative, skilled and easy to achieve the learner’s goal of cultivating competence-oriented skills.
    2. **During the phase of teaching and evaluating :** 
    ways of learning and teaching are more interactive, being efficiently adapted into existing subject goals.
    3. **During the phase of delivering :**
    teachers can feel dominated to communicate with stakeholders and validate teaching performance persuasively.

## My Reflection

The biggest learning from the project is how to turn this policy issue into an actionable solution in a short time and limited resource. I found that analysing the research in the macro and micro level - from the problem landscape to the relationships between school, government, and communities helped massively to see the pattern and holistic view of the problem.

I also learned that in a wicked problem, there can be more than one leverage point. To discover the best solution, creating rapid prototypes and experimentation with people within the system is a way of inspiring everyone to exchange perspectives and to open conversation what works best.​

The strong point of this project is I am trying to build the **decentralised co-op platform** where all stakeholders have the same voice to participate via different formats and gradually feel and see the improvements of the reform stage by stage. The weak point would be I didn’t organise more experiments for six guidance toolkits in pivoting pupils learning performances as a competence-oriented learner.

### Bottom-up & decentralised co-op strategies for education reform

Under the new curriculum reform guideline, we try to use decentralised platform to bring collaborations in teaching profession and confidences in Education within whole society.

### Design for bridging the gap between policy and practice

**Change of orientation from a focus on things to persons :** 

From the elements of education reform to the provider’s stories in the education service - teacher’s stories and needs to design solutions into real practices.
