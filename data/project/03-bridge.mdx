summary: "The beginning of Bridge was motivated by my previous experience in teaching. After I noticed that a new education reform in Taiwan had been made to look beyond test-driven pedagogy in 2019, I was personally curious about whether the society is ready for the big change. In this project, to ensure I was designing solutions for the real problem, I collaborated with my previous colleagues in Na-Ba primary school where the change has come. Through the human-centered design process we discovered opportunities and designed solutions that can bridge the gap between policy and implementation."

> **Bridge is a vision for a service platform designed as an assistant for primary school teachers experiencing curriculum reform in Taiwan to foster lifelong competencies in their pupils and strengthen relationships between parents, schools and students.**

#### üëÄ PROCESS OVERVIEW

Through interviews & observation I discovered the opportunity to reduce the pressure teachers have experienced in **designing new curricula plans for the reform**. Test-driven pedagogy has been overwhelmingly prevalent in Taiwan over 20 years, so **building trust** between **parents** and **teachers** had a large effect on teachers‚Äô workflow. However, when transitioning to the new reform, it‚Äôs hard for teachers to signify **how learners progress without utilizing grades or scores**. Moreover, **facing this new uncertainty alone** discouraged teachers to try new ways of teaching.

I **sketched with teachers**, and **held co-creation workshops with parents**. After analysing my work, I **developed and tested the Bridge platform**. In user testing I found that **by adding community issues into curricula design**, it allowed teachers to build curricula plans based on both **subjects needs** and **real-world exercises** within the classroom, while providing parents **clear** and **comprehensible** information of pupil‚Äôs learning performance.

#### üìì RESEARCH

<StyledImage objectFit="cover" srcLeft="bridge-06.png" srcRight="bridge-08.png" flexLeft={1} flexRight={1} width={100} bg="transparent" gap={1}/>

To understand how schools have experienced during the transition of pedagogy, I visited the head teacher in Na-Ba primary school. After talking with him who managed the school, I realised that due to **pressure from the government** who expected schools to implement the reform successfully, he was looking to **improve the teaching process** just like other head teachers. Therefore, I collaborated with his school to understand **teachers‚Äô needs**. During the process, I **interviewed** 3 teachers and **facilitated 2 co-creation workshops** with parents.

I started by conducting **contextual inquiries** which help me hear directly from teachers by talking, seeing them in their actual work environment. I then interviewed them with sketching sessions. With the **sketching process**, they were able to tell exactly what they have experienced on every touch point while teaching and beyond. 

On the other hand, parents were the key stakeholders in this issue because of **their influences on both teachers and pupils**. To understand their thoughts of teaching activities, I ran **co-creation sessions** with them. However, rather than interviewing how they feel about the reform, I invited them to **design a lesson plan for their children** in the workshop. It was a crucial step to understand what parents care about **beyond pupils‚Äô performance of achieving high grades**.

##### Key Takeaways

<Highlight width={48}>The reform was made to change the teaching process that teachers all agreed with, but they were struggling to change the culture for the society to trust in the reform and their teaching profession.</Highlight>

<Highlight width={48}>A clear and understandable way to know pupils‚Äô learning achievement is important for parents to feel the progress.</Highlight>

##### Teacher's User Journey

![Teacher's User Journey](/photos/bridge-07.png)

**Key insights from teacher‚Äôs current journey**
> - Teachers enjoy **trying new ways of teaching**, and love to figure it out with pupils in the classroom. Although it's a bit different from the previous pedagogy, they feel encouraged when **pupils respond and engage in the class discussion**.
> - The feedback of pupils' learning performance is **not understandable and pursuable** for both pupils and parents.
> - As society looks to disagree with the reform, teachers are worried and confused about **the effort they have made**.

#### üéÅ THE DESIGN

<StyledImage objectFit="cover" srcLeft="bridge-03.png" flexLeft={1} flexRight={0} width={100} bg="transparent"/>

#### Bridge helps teachers bring parents clear and comprehensive results of learning performance that pupils learned from solving a real problem around their living area.

Inside Bridge, teachers steer integration of teaching content with **community issues around their living area** through the platform of **curricula knowledge network** and **guidence modules**. On the other hand, teachers share pupils‚Äô performance with parents through **one touch sharing** which is linked to [Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(software) "An instant communication platform which is commonly used in Taiwan"), and in doing so help parents and society to understand the importance of education that goes beyond grades.

#### üïπÔ∏è TESTING

User Tests were carried out in-person in Na-Ba primary school and three parents. I completed two rounds of testing.
**1. Can six guidance modules as toolkits help teachers address curricula design, providing **flexible combinations** between social issues and teaching contents?**
We tested it with science class, by using the modules, combining water shortage issues with the subject contents.

**2. When teachers set subject plans, how‚Äôs the filters designed in the Bridge?**
After testing with teachers, I discovered that they have a potential need for implementing school development goal which is related to social issues, so I changed the content of filter from ‚Äúsocial issues‚Äù to ‚Äúschool development goal‚Äù, at the same time, I added ‚ÄúResources near school‚Äù to help teachers easily connect with those resources they need for school development goal.

#### üíé GOING FORWARD

I learned that in a wicked problem, there can be more than one leverage point. To discover the solution, creating rapid prototypes is a great way to test with people within the system. Everyone can learn from others‚Äô perspectives and open conversation about what works best. 

In future rounds of testing, it would be important to research how Bridge interacts with teachers who are multitasking such as teachers in the rural area. Is it still intuitive and helpful for them?
