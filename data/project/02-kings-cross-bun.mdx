summary: "The Playbook for the King‚Äôs Cross Bun was a project I developed with a biologist Shun-Te Wang, supported by Dr Maria Chang of the King‚Äôs Cross Bun Project. It aimed to help the King‚Äôs Cross Bun Project, an initiative that was promoting heritage grains in London, to create its organisational development plan."

#### üìì RESEARCH
##### Define organisational challenges
King‚Äôs Cross Bun aims to reconnect producers, customers, academics, and our planet with heritage grains. Through interviews with working group, we identified the following as the most pressing organisational challenges for them:
> - **They struggled to prioritise in order in terms of different funding and cooperative opportunities**
> - **They continuously reorganised its organisational mission according to their ongoing projects.**
> - **They faced difficulties in integrating the scientific and traditional perspective of sustainable agriculture.**

##### Explore opportunities of heritage grains
On the other hand, to develop the playbook that not only helped the working group overcome their organisational challenges but also enriched the network of king‚Äôs cross bun across the food supply chain of heritage grains, we did the following research points:

`Scientific Evidence` : **The potential of Heritage Grain**
Evaluate a general science literature review of heritage grain to support our campaign with solid evidence.
`Market Trend` : **Current food and social trends**
Reviewing market trend reports to understand consumer behaviours, so we can conceive an effective strategy that can promote heritage grain.
`Stakeholders Management` : **Relationships between the working group and  community partners**
Assessing the advantages and necessaries of the current or potential partners, so we can build up a connected network that brings mutual benefits to each stakeholder.

#### üéÅ THE DESIGN

The playbook was designed as a two-part **illustrated guidance** to overcome the above challenges. The first part is a **'modularised‚Äô organisational blueprint**. Unlike the conventional layered Vision-Goal-Impact approach, in our playbook we turned Goals and Impacts into **blocks**, allowing the organiser to assemble them into different project proposals according to different funding and cooperative opportunities while maintaining different proposals.

Each of the blocks is supported by relevant **scientific literature review** or **social context research**. 

The second part is a **project manager‚Äôs toolkit** customised for the King‚Äôs Cross Bun Project‚Äôs needs. It includes step-by-step instructions for tools such as **stakeholder mapping** and a series of examples based on our **case study of NGOs** with similar missions.

#### üíé GOING FORWARD

After the project finished by Feb 2020, the Playbook became one of the regular operational tools for the King‚Äôs Cross Bun Project.
