summary: "In collaboration with CERN, Agri+ was a project exploring opportunities of emerging technologies within the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I did research, stakeholders mapping with the team of fibre-optic sensors at CERN. During the process, we explored potential markets for fibre-optic sensors, then designed for small-scale tea farmers in Kenya. With the design of a knowledge transfer network run on the soil sensors, tea farmers are able to make wiser decisions that were tailored to their cropsâ€™ needs."

#### ðŸ‘€ PROCESS OVERVIEW
Through **desk research**, **interviews** and **field research** at CERN Headquarter for 5 days, we settled on a CERN technology [FOSS4](https://kt.cern/success-stories/foss4-irrigation-how-can-high-energy-physics-help-water-shortage "FOSS4 Irrigation: how can high-energy physics help with water shortage? | Knowledge Transfer"), a system for optimised irrigation, based on technologies developed for high-energy physics. In order to deeply understand FOSS4, we ran **co-creation** workshops with scientists at CERN, and shortlisted specific opportunities for more research of potential users. After research and analysing, we defined our **user persona**, and **user needs**. We build the proposition while **validating** it with stakeholders such as investment bankers, scientists and agricultural experts in Kenya via **online interviews**.

#### ðŸ““ RESEARCH

##### Explore potential markets that require the advantages of CERNâ€™s Fibre-optic sensors
Fibre-optic sensors can collect data of soil temperature, soil humidity, concentration of pesticides and fertilisers and enzymes in the soil, then send data to the data centre. To understand how it might be applied in the form of a product service proposal, we analysed key advantages of the sensor in the **workshop with CERN**. Those three key advantages of the sensor are:
> - Sensors send data to data Acquisition via physical fibre which do not require any power and internet.
> - Cheap fibre from tele-companies.
> - The size of data is small.

We explored potential markets through **desk research** such as global market trends, future of agriculture, soil,etc. On the other hand, we **analysed** existing sensor-data platforms and **interviewed** people who have been involved in tackling soil issues in terms of sustainable development goals.
