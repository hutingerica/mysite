summary: "Agri+ was a project at RCA exploring opportunities of emerging technologies in UNâ€™s SDGs, mainly collaborating with the key stakeholder - CERN in the field of fibre-optic sensors. To explore and define reliable use of fibre-optic sensors, conducted stakeholder mapping and desk research. With the vision of solid small-scale farming experience during the design process, envisioned a platform with data-driven impacts. The final result was an exhibition displaying the whole service experience."
