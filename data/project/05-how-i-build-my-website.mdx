summary: "With very limited programming experience, I was always curious about making prototypes through codes rather than just mockups. In 2021 I began my front-end skills learning journey by building my own portfolio website. Through learning from recent website production tools and technologies, I made it from scratch with a lot of trials and errors. The learning process and the result might not be as expected as I imagined at the beginning, but they have brought me a different perspective on modern website production. Here’s some learning thoughts I would love to share with someone thinking about learning programming as a designer."

##### It’s like using Figma to design but no need to set up animations.
My goal isn't to become a world-class engineer — that would be the work of a lifetime, and an entirely separate career! When I was building this portfolio website, my biggest priority was to find a solution that would let me embed custom design in the site, like this summary panel. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs), [github](https://github.com), [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) are five ingredients I learned to cook my site mainly. By using these tools, for example, I could edit codes while seeing any instant updates on the website I have deployed. This incredible live-preview way gives me more actuality of my designs, helping me instantly prototype in different sizes of screen and scenarios. Therefore, the gap between design and production was eliminated surprisingly, and I felt more competent at both design and prototyping.

##### Bringing exact designs to the screen makes me happy all the day.
When it comes to the styling, I hope to bring exact designs on the screen through writing codes. It’s an undoubted challenge for me to practice writing all the styles from scratch. I mainly used [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) and learned styling skills from [Josh’s](https://www.joshwcomeau.com) [CSS for JavaScript Developer](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js). However, I really enjoyed the styling process and behind the scenes learning to manage all the codes logically. It was about the skill of staying organised and thinking out of the box to make every design into codes.

##### Turning design into production is an art — from design systems to component libraries.
Component library is a collection of generic, reusable components like buttons, cards and inputs which can be dropped into multiple applications and don't have to build everything from scratch. In my case, I used [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) to make my own component library. During my tries, I was so surprised how beautiful and scalable these codes can be. If a design system is a place designers combine their design styles, components and patterns in the scale, the component library is a place engineers map all of those design elements neatly and maintainable. Therefore, turning design into production is not just about pixels but the structure of collaboration between designers and engineers.

Here’s my try on setting CSS colours variables which can dynamically alter my styles based on my button state. Does it look like a light shift?
