#### üëÄ PROJECT OVERVIEW
![Cover](/photos/designsystem-00.png)

[PDIS (Public Digital Innovation Space)](https://twitter.com/taiwanpdis) is an innovation lab supervised by [Taiwanes Digital Minister Audrey Tang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang). The organisation formed a team to kickstart the making of design system that allows more consistent style and credibility on the governmental websites. Moreover,Consistency here is key to a smoother user experience. Without consistency, it is very difficult for citizens to trust and tell if a website is official or not.

On the other hand, PDIS constantly receives the requests of building digital service websites where the work involved was oftentimes overlapped with other similar requests. For example, a form component made for identity verification can be easily reused for another agency. Moreover, requests could be with a very tight schedule, which makes it really difficult to deliver solid services that are fully tested and verified by real users.

Therefore, the development of the design system is beneficial to PDIS itself and the IT companies commissioned to make digital services for the Taiwanese government who face the problem above.

#### üí° PROCESS
##### Iterate weekly
We are a very small team with 2 designers, 2 researchers and 1 developer. Without experience in making a design system, we set a weekly component design challenge and reviewed our progress every week. It helped us build guidance for the design system with clearer, more specific design and implementation guidance.

##### Build the design structure for modularity and scalability
 Using Figma and open-source engineering tools, we created a collection of standards for design and front end code. It's a library of proven, reusable design components and assets with a guide on how to use them. The goal of a design system is to help teams achieve higher efficiency, consistency, and scalability when building digital products.

  > - With structured design components, typographic flexibility, consistent color system and considering code development, we bring a scalable way for developers, designers, and researchers to rock markups.
  > - Moreover, learning from every solid mockup through real source code linked with design, we can push our boundaries to prototype more user scenarios and build consistently and incrementally.

##### Learn from other design systems
Thanks to global government design system communities. To best understand our way of making Taiwanese design system, we studied many great existing design systems from both public and private sectors and interviewed people who are in the making process.

#### üïπÔ∏è RESULTS & GOING FORWARD
##### Designers are able to prototype different user scenarios with more flexibility, consistency and efficiency.
##### Developers can easily build websites from the design.
##### Next Step
