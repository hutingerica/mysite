summary: "After reading the book “Drawdown : The most comprehensive plan ever proposed to reverse global warming”, I was personally curious about how we individuals can take action on climate change issues. This side project was focused on opportunities that can eliminate the carbon footprint associated with household food waste."

#### 👀 PROJECT OVERVIEW
While food waste occurs in all stages of the food supply chain, the astonishing scale of food waste results in the private household sector. To help fight food waste from households, the research was started from households’ shopping behaviours, and understanding the decision making of their purchase behind.

By **shadowing** and **interviewing** different types of households living in Bristol, the key finding showed that there’s a need for households to practice re-valuing under-valued surplus. Following that, through **cooking experiments**, it led to brainstorming about how to use the power of food waste to help unite people and food through cooking together, in order to ensure food is being eaten rather than ending up in the bin.

#### 📓 RESEARCH
In the UK, over 70% of surplus foods (excluding inedible food) results in the household sector. In addition, most people said they want to stop wasting food and agreed that ‘food waste is an important national issue’. Yet UK households continue to throw away 6.6 million tonnes of food per year. Why is this?
> 1. It’s too hard to buy small amounts of ingredients.
> 2. Buying huge amounts is always saving money, and saving time on shopping.
> 3. Throwing away ugly or unused part of an ingredient is saving much more time and money than looking for solutions.

It's a treat and convenience that food is very easy to have for consumers nowadays. However, the price of food we saw in the supermarkets and the effort we take to get food are too low to reveal how luxurious it is to waste food. As a result, the value of food has been under-valued from the journey of grocery shopping.

##### The value of food needs to be appreciated from every purchase to ensure food is being eaten rather than ending up in the bin. But how?

<InsightThoughts width={100} number="01" insight="Spending time on cooking surplus is not interesting and necessary" picSrc="beyondflavour-05.png">Cooking plays an important role in not only providing meals but offering a space to appreciate and re-value under-valued surplus. However, busy living drives food choices. To cook means people need to work out the time to utilise those ingredients in the fridge they have bought and stored. Secondly, making food is easily associated with feeding a hungry stomach. It’s definitely a must have activity in our daily lives. However, surrounded with many delicious food choices nowadays, often the last thing people want to do when feeling hungry is cook.</InsightThoughts>
<InsightThoughts width={100} number="02" insight="Historically, we have valued food a lot.
" picSrc="beyondflavour-04.png">People were really good creators preserving food against seasonal shortage of foods, before the common refrigerator was invented. For example, alcohol, jams, a pot of pickle and smoky bacon, lots of these current foodstuffs exist today, as a result of early preservation techniques. However, the birth of fridges brought us convenience while it is the convenience itself that slips us a chance to take fresh food for granted. This lets us forget about the precious life span of food, to a point that we aren’t aware anymore. We have become consumers of food rather than creators of food. This led us thinking: is it possible we consumers become creators again nowadays?</InsightThoughts>

##### Cooking experiments 🧑‍🍳 👩‍🍳

**Making food with surplus food can be boundless opportunities, like a delightful treat, instead of daily challenges like dull errands**. Therefore, setting challenges to cook with everyday random surplus but with constraints on only one type of recipe, we came up with **8 different cooking experiments**, including pasta, curry, sausage roll, bao, pizza, fried rice, stew and dumplings. Those go-to processes are hassle-free to kinds of surplus during our testing, easily performed in many kinds of kitchens. Moreover, **the power of cooking together can bring people a sense of belonging, which brings incentives that are beyond just well fed**.

Dumplings, a universal concept that consists of a piece of dough wrapping around a ball of filling, jumped out as the best option as households can really process everything with just about flour and water. It’s also a very versatile idea that can always develop new dumpling filling creations, even sweet ones! On the other hand, each dumpling is then individually quick **frozen** and **easy to store**, which avoids further food waste and makes dumplings come in handy for following cooking without effort. Furthermore, through more tries on combinations of dough skins, fillings, ways of preparing and sauces, a magical formula emerged!

This universal formula keeps everytime creation of dumplings challenging but interesting. For example, using doughs coloured by beetroot, fillings of minced pork and chopped vegetables, and then here comes the unique purple gyoza after pan-fried.

**The process of making dumplings also can bring people together in a challenging but enjoyable environment while ensuring that surplus food is valued and utilised**. While people at the kitchen are chopping the ingredients, others are developing dough skins. Moreover, the filling and folding parts bring everyone making food together in the house and thinking beyond the flavours of food. It’s a very important grassroots initiative that everybody can connect, share ideas, and even brush up cooking skills. Moreover, it is very accessible.

#### 🎁 Work in Progress
“Let’s make dumplings in 100 ways” shows senses of collaboration and connection to each other, and ingredients! Therefore, the stage for now is to find opportunitie….
