summary: "After reading the book ‚ÄúDrawdown : The most comprehensive plan ever proposed to reverse global warming‚Äù, I was personally curious about how we individuals can take action on climate change issues. This side project was focused on opportunities that can eliminate the carbon footprint associated with household food waste."

#### üëÄ PROJECT OVERVIEW
While food waste occurs in all stages of the food supply chain, the astonishing scale of food waste results in the private household sector. To help fight food waste from households, the research was started from households‚Äô shopping behaviours, and understanding the decision making of their purchase behind.

By **shadowing** and **interviewing** different types of households, the key insight - **"It‚Äôs easier than ever to get ingredients nowadays, to an extent that we forget how precious they were."** revealed that there‚Äôs a need for households to practice re-valuing under-valued surplus. Following that, through **cooking experiments**, it led to brainstorming about how to use the power of cooking together to re-value surplus food we bought to tackle household food waste. Know more about details below.

#### üìì RESEARCH
In the UK, over 70% of surplus foods (excluding inedible food) results in the household sector. In addition, most people said they want to stop wasting food and agreed that ‚Äòfood waste is an important national issue‚Äô. Yet UK households continue to throw away 6.6 million tonnes of food per year. Why is this?

<InsightThoughts width={100} number="Fact 01" insight="It‚Äôs too hard to buy small amounts of ingredients.
" picSrc="">Nowadays, retail has been very good at reducing the price of food. And it‚Äôs driven the cost down all the way through to a level where it doesn‚Äôt matter if food was wasted because it didn‚Äôt cost that much. Moreover, it's a treat and convenience that food is very easy to have for consumers nowadays. However, the price of food we saw in the supermarkets and the effort we take to get food are too low to reveal how luxurious it is to waste food. As a result, the value of food has been under-valued from the journey of grocery shopping.</InsightThoughts>

<InsightThoughts width={100} number="Fact 02" insight="It‚Äôs not necessary and no much fun in dealing with surplus food" picSrc="">Cooking plays an important role in not only providing meals but offering a space to appreciate and re-value under-valued surplus. However, busy living drives food choices. To cook means people need to work out the time to utilise those ingredients in the fridge they have bought and stored. Secondly, making food is easily associated with feeding a hungry stomach. It‚Äôs definitely a must have activity in our daily lives. However, surrounded with many delicious food choices nowadays, often the last thing people want to do when feeling hungry is cook.</InsightThoughts>

<InsightThoughts width={100} number="Fact 03" insight="Historically, we had a need to value surplus food" picSrc="">People were really good creators preserving food to against seasonal shortage of foods, before the common refrigerator was invented. For example, alcohol, jams, a pot of pickle and smoky bacon, lots of these current foodstuffs exist today, as a result of early preservation techniques. However, the birth of fridges brought us convenience while it is the convenience itself that slips us a chance to take fresh food for granted. This lets us forget about the precious life span of food, to a point that we aren‚Äôt aware anymore. </InsightThoughts>

#### üí° Insight

##### It‚Äôs unavoidable that we buy more than we need.
It‚Äôs too hard to buy ingredients in small quantities. When shopping groceries, we are often prompted with a dilemma of buying in bulk cheaper or less but more expensive. It‚Äôs a true dilemma because we knew we didn‚Äôt need that much, and it‚Äôs not that we want to buy a lot but rather the supply chain often nudges us, ending up buying more than we need. With these options at hand, it‚Äôs unavoidable that we often find ourselves buying more than we would need.

##### It‚Äôs easier than ever to get ingredients nowadays, to an extent that we forget how precious they were.
For people who spend time cooking, way less time is spent on dealing with surplus food. The need for dealing with surplus food is not enough for people to spend time on nowadays. Throwing away ugly or unused part of an ingredient is saving much more time and money than looking for solutions. Interestingly, our ancestors have valued food surplus against shortage of foods. Rich preservation techniques were developed which indicates how our ancestors care and are aware of the value of ingredients.

Generation after generation, households have become consumers of food rather than creators of food. This led us thinking: is it possible we consumers become creators again nowadays?

#### üéÅ Theme: Practice re-value undervalued surplus food we bought.

##### Opportunity area: 
> 1. Re-value through **cooking** surplus food.
> 2. Enjoy spending time on surplus food through **cooking together**.

##### Opportunity Area 01 : Re-value through cooking surplus food.

Cooking plays an important role in terms of re-valuing food. The more we spend time cooking, the better chance we have to reconnect and appreciate food and ingredients. To further explore re-valuing surplus food. We came up with 8 different cooking experiments - that are adaptable to everyday household food surplus, and easy to make in any home kitchen. These recipes include pasta, curry, sausage roll, bao, pizza, fried rice, stew and dumplings.

##### Opportunity Area 02 :Enjoy spending time on surplus food through cooking together.
<StyledImage objectFit="cover" srcLeft="beyondflavour-10.png" flexLeft={1} width={100} bg="transparent" gap={1} />
People are social animals and spend immense time connecting with each other. I want to test out if cooking together helps people enjoy spending time on surplus food and why. After further cooking experiments, there‚Äôs an interesting finding that making food together brings people together in a challenging but enjoyable environment while ensuring that surplus food is valued and utilised.

Taking making dumplings as an example, when people at the kitchen are chopping the ingredients, others are developing dough skins. Moreover, the step of filling and folding brings everyone around the table thinking about the flavours, sharing folding techniques, chatting about the surplus ingredients and more. The power of cooking together that everybody can connect, share ideas, and even brush up cooking skills encourages people to deal with surplus food.

<Highlight width={100}>How might we use the power of cooking together to re-value surplus food we bought to tackle household food waste?</Highlight>
The senses of collaboration and connection to each other shows an interesting reconnection to ingredients. To explore the opportunity of leverage cooking together further, I organised a workshop to make dumplings together and brainstormed with participants.
