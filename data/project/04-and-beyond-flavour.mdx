summary: "After reading the book “Drawdown : The most comprehensive plan ever proposed to reverse global warming”, Shu and I were personally curious about how we individuals can take action on climate change issues. With experience in cooking and food technology, our exploration was focused on opportunities that can eliminate the carbon footprint associated with household food waste."

#### 👀 PROJECT & PROCESS OVERVIEW
While food waste occurs in all stages of the food supply chain, surprisingly, the astonishing scale of food waste results in the **private household sector**. Therefore, we conducted **shadowing** and **interviews** with different types of households living in Bristol to collect insights from their **shopping to cooking behaviour**. On the other hand, we organised **cooking challenges** with them to understand how they deal with surplus food in their kitchen. Know more about my process below.

#### 📓 RESEARCH
In the UK, over 70% of surplus foods (excluding inedible food) results in the household sector. In addition, most people said they want to stop wasting food and agreed that ‘food waste is an important national issue’. Yet UK households continue to throw away 6.6 million tonnes of food per year. Why is this? We started our research journey from shopping behaviours of households, understanding the decision making of their purchase behind.
> 1. It’s too hard to buy small amounts of ingredients.
> 2. Buying huge amounts is always saving money, and saving time on shopping.
> 3. Throwing away ugly or unused part of an ingredient is saving much more time and money than looking for solutions.

Nowadays, retail has been very good at reducing the price of food. And it’s driven the cost down all the way through to a level where **it doesn’t matter if food was wasted because it hasn’t got that much value**. Moreover, it's a treat that food is very easy to have for consumers. There's no need to understand the sources of food and any concept of where it comes from and what it takes to produce it.

Consequently, the value of food has been under-valued from the journey of grocery shopping. In terms of the environment, the price we saw in the supermarkets and the effort we take to get food are too low to reveal how luxurious it is to waste food. Therefore, **the value of food needs to be re-considered and appreciated from every purchase**.

<InsightThoughts width={100} number="01" insight="How might we make households aware of the preciousness of food in order reduce food waste?" picSrc="beyondflavour-03.png">There are many existing solutions or products aiming to reduce food waste. However, most solutions, for example, breadcrumb-made beer Toast, are designed to be consumed within a competitive market price again. As a result, people jump into the decision making of buying beers (products), not the process of considering the value of food environmentally.</InsightThoughts>

What if 🤔 … Change the role of consumer
##### Can consumers become creators against food waste?
